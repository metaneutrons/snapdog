//! Receiver provider abstraction for passive audio sources.
//!
//! A [`ReceiverProvider`] is a network-advertised audio sink that external apps
//! (iPhone, Spotify, etc.) can stream to. Each zone spawns its own set of receivers.
//!
//! All receivers produce the same output:
//! - **F32 interleaved PCM** via [`AudioSender`] (any sample rate, any channel count)
//! - **Events** via [`ReceiverEventTx`] (metadata, cover art, progress, volume, remote control)
//!
//! The zone player resamples F32 audio to the target rate and converts to S16LE
//! at the output boundary.
